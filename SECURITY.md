- Audit logging for all data changes
- User-based access control

### Web Security
- CSRF protection considerations
- XSS prevention through proper escaping
- Content Security Policy headers recommended
- Secure cookie attributes

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data not logged
- Database encryption at rest supported
- Secure transmission over HTTPS
- Regular security assessments

## Security Features

### Built-in Security
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries throughout
- **XSS Protection**: Output escaping in templates
- **Authentication**: Secure session management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Audit Logging**: All actions logged with user context

### Configuration Security
- **Secret Management**: Configuration secrets properly managed
- **Database Security**: Secure database connections
- **Network Security**: Configurable network binding
- **File Permissions**: Proper file system permissions

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure
We follow a coordinated disclosure policy:

1. **Private Report**: Vulnerability reported privately
2. **Investigation**: We investigate and confirm the issue
3. **Fix Development**: We develop a fix
4. **Testing**: We test the fix thoroughly
5. **Release**: We release a security update
6. **Public Disclosure**: We publish a security advisory

### Timeline
- **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
- **Day 1-2**: Acknowledgment sent
- **Day 3-7**: Initial assessment completed
- **Day 8-30**: Fix developed and tested
- **Day 30+**: Security update released
- **Day 32+**: Public disclosure (after users have time to update)

### Credit
We believe in giving credit where it's due:
- Security researchers will be credited in security advisories
- Hall of fame for security contributors
- Acknowledgment in release notes
