## Chlorine

For swimming pools, ideal free chlorine levels should be between 1.0 and 3.0 ppm (parts per million). The total chlorine level should ideally be about the same as the free chlorine, or slightly higher. Combined chlorine, which is free chlorine that has combined with contaminants, should ideally be as close to zero as possible.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

**Free Chlorine:**

This is the chlorine available to sanitize the pool water. The ideal range is 1.0-3.0 ppm. Maintaining free chlorine levels within this range ensures effective disinfection and prevents issues like algae growth or bacterial contamination. 

**Total Chlorine:**
.
This is the sum of both free chlorine and combined chlorine. In an ideal pool, the total chlorine level will be close to the free chlorine level. If the total chlorine is significantly higher, it indicates the presence of combined chlorine, which can cause irritation. 

**Combined Chlorine:**
.
This is the chlorine that has reacted with contaminants like ammonia and nitrogen. It is also known as chloramines. Combined chlorine is less effective at sanitizing and can cause unpleasant odors and skin/eye irritation. Ideally, combined chlorine levels should be below 0.2 ppm. 

**Ratio:**
.
The ideal ratio is for free chlorine to be significantly higher than combined chlorine. If you see a large difference between total and free chlorine, it's time to "shock" the pool to oxidize the combined chlorine and restore the free chlorine levels.

Free chlorine as the fresh, clean chlorine that's ready to work, and combined chlorine as the used, less effective chlorine. You want to maintain a good level of fresh chlorine and minimize the amount of used chlorine. 

**CYA (Cyanuric Acid):**

The presence of CYA (stabilizer) in the pool water affects how chlorine dissipates. Higher CYA levels mean chlorine is more stable, but it also means you need a higher free chlorine level to be effective. 

**pH:**
Maintain a pH level between 7.4 and 7.6 for optimal chlorine effectiveness and swimmer comfort.
