The Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) is the difference between the actual (measured) pH and the calculated pH of water. In the 1930s, Dr. Wilfred Langelier developed his index to know if/when water becomes corrosive or scale-forming. The LSI tells us approximately how saturated water is with calcium carbonate (CaCO3).

The LSI is only an approximation of the tendency, but not a direct measure, of the corrosive nature of the water. The LSI helps to predict whether the water will dissolve existing calcium carbonate (corrosive) or deposit it as scale. In an over-saturated condition, excess calcium carbonate drops out of the solution and forms scale (or cloudy water). In an under-saturated condition, the relationship between calcium carbonate and alkalinity may increase the corrosiveness of water. 

The sign and magnitude of the Langelier index show the water’s tendency to form or dissolve scale and thus to inhibit or encourage corrosion.

The Langelier index is calculated using the following inputs (we ignore cyanuric acid here):

* Alkalinity
* pH
* Calcium concentration
* Total dissolved solids
* Water temperature

where the calculation is summarized as the following. Note the use of factors instead of actual concentrations.

(pH) + (Temperature ºF factor) + (Calcium Hardness factor) + [(Total Alkalinity ppm) - (CYA ppm x correction factor @ current pH)] - (TDS factor) = LSI

### Interpreting the LSI

* **Positive LI** – Water is over saturated with calcium carbonate and has a tendency of depositing calcium carbonate, forming scales in the pipes or the distribution system.
* **Negative LI** – Water is under saturated and has a tendency of being corrosive in pipes or distribution networks.
* **Near-zero LI** – Water is saturated with calcium carbonate; neither strongly scale forming or corrosive.
  
A balanced LSI (ideally between -0.3 and +0.3) suggests the water is neither corrosive nor scale-forming.
