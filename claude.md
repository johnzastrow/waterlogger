# App Development Discussion Notes

## Initial Discussion
- Starting conversation about building an app
- Date: 2025-07-12

## App Concept
Basic Tkinter to SQLite desktop application - a simple note-taking app with CRUD operations

## Technical Requirements
- Python with Tkinter (built-in GUI library)
- SQLite database (no external dependencies)
- Single Windows executable
- Minimal dependencies for easy distribution

## Database Schema
- Table: notes
- Fields: note_id (INT, auto-increment), note (TEXT)

## Features Required
- Main screen with data grid showing all notes
- CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- Edit dialog with dedicated controls + Save/Cancel buttons
- Delete confirmation dialog
- New Record button for adding notes
- Close button to exit app and close DB connection
- Export to Excel functionality
- Export to Markdown table (.md file)

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up basic Tkinter window structure
2. Create SQLite database and notes table
3. Implement data grid display (likely using Treeview)
4. Add CRUD operations with dialog windows
5. Implement export functionality (Excel and Markdown)
6. Package as single executable

## Architecture Decisions (from requirements.md)

### Data Management
1. SQLite database stored in same directory as executable ✓
2. No database migration/versioning needed ✓

### UI Layout & Design
3. Window: 900px wide, resizable ✓
4. Data grid: No sorting/filtering required ✓
5. Edit dialog: Modal dialog using Tkinter ✓

### Export Functionality
6. Excel export: Use openpyxl library ✓
7. Exports: Include timestamps ✓

### Error Handling & UX
8. Database errors: Display as red labels in UI ✓
9. Note validation: Warn at 200 chars, error at 255 chars (displayed as UI labels) ✓
10. Confirmations: Delete + Save edit confirmations ✓

### Packaging & Distribution
11. Packaging: PyInstaller ✓
12. Target platforms: Windows 11 and Ubuntu Linux 22.04 ✓

## Additional Implementation Details to Consider

### Code Structure & Organization
1. Should we use a single main.py file or split into modules (database, ui, exports)? **Single main.py file** ✓
2. Class-based approach or functional programming style? **Functional programming style** ✓

### Database Details
3. Database filename convention? **notes.db** ✓
4. Should we create the database/table on first run if it doesn't exist? **Yes, auto-create** ✓
5. Connection handling - single connection or open/close per operation? **Open/Close Per Operation** ✓

### UI Component Specifics
6. Treeview columns - show note_id and truncated note? **Always display full note text** ✓
7. How to handle long notes in the grid display? **Show full text** ✓
8. Button layout and positioning preferences? **Place buttons above the data grid** ✓
9. Status bar for showing messages/errors vs inline labels? **Use inline labels** ✓

### Export File Details
10. Export filename format? **Ask user where to save, defaults: notes_export.md, notes_export.xlsx** ✓
11. Excel sheet name and formatting? **Sheet name: "Exported Notes", no formatting** ✓
12. Markdown table format and columns? **GitHub formatting** ✓

### Error Scenarios
13. Read-only export location handling? **Report all database errors** ✓
14. Database locked by another process? **Report any locks** ✓
15. Empty database export behavior? **Create databases/tables if not present** ✓

### User Experience
16. Default focus on startup? **Use reasonable, free, easily available icons** ✓
17. Keyboard shortcuts? **Ctrl+N for new record, Ctrl+S for save** ✓
18. Window icon and title? **Title: "Demo Notes"** ✓

## Development Notes

### Environment Setup ✓
- Tkinter installed via: `sudo apt install python3-tk`
- Dependencies managed with uv: `uv add openpyxl`
- All functionality tested and working

### Implementation Complete ✓
- All core features implemented and tested
- Database auto-creation working
- UI components functioning properly
- Export functionality verified
- Character validation working
- Keyboard shortcuts operational

### Issues Fixed During Development
1. **Tree packing issue** - Fixed tree/scrollbar parent-child relationships
2. **Modal dialog grab error** - Added update_idletasks() before grab_set()
3. **File dialog parameters** - Changed initialvalue to initialfile
4. **Data grid visual overlap** - Increased row height and added styling
5. **Grid lines** - Added styling for better visual separation
